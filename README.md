# PAFE - PRIVATE SAFE
This app is targeted for anything that needs password encryption. Currently it only has support for password management.

MOTO: One password to rule them all.

<!-- ## Predictions -->
<!-- 1. Add support for file encryption -->

## About encryption
PAFE encrypts using AES-256-GCM algorithm with a master key,
which is derived using PBKDF2 algorithm from the master password.

## About setup
Install node dependencies (using either `yarn` or `npm`):
The development files are under the `src` directory, `main.js` is the project entrypoint.
